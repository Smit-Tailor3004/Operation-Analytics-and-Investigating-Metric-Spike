# Operation-Analytics-and-Investigating-Metric-Spike

1) Project Overview:-
This project is designed to explore operational analytics by investigating metric spikes in organizational data using advanced SQL techniques. The project emphasizes the use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for structuring and simplifying complex queries, allowing for in-depth data analysis and anomaly detection.

2) Features:-
  i) Identification of Metric Spikes: Analyze operational data to identify spikes or anomalies in key metrics.
  ii) Root Cause Analysis: Investigate the underlying causes of these metric spikes using advanced SQL techniques.
  iii) CTE (Common Table Expressions): Simplify complex queries and make data extraction more efficient.
  iv) Comprehensive Reporting: Provide clear reports and visualizations of operational performance trends and issues.

3) Tools and Technologies:-
  i) SQL (Structured Query Language),
  ii) CTEs (Common Table Expressions),
  iii) Database Management System (DBMS)

4) Usage:-
Load your operational data into the database.
Execute the provided SQL scripts to analyze the data for metric spikes.
Investigate any detected anomalies by examining the corresponding CTE-based queries.

5) How This Project Can Help in the Market
Improve Operational Efficiency: This analysis helps organizations identify and understand key spikes in operational metrics, enabling them to take action to mitigate inefficiencies.
Root Cause Detection: By using CTEs, this project helps streamline the process of detecting and investigating the root causes of operational issues, ensuring a clear understanding of performance drivers.
Optimize Business Performance: Data-driven insights from this project can help decision-makers take informed actions to optimize overall business performance.
